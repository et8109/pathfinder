uses kivy and buildozer

to test locally without device:
    python main.py

deploy to phone: 
    buildozer android debug deploy run (runs main.py)

if phone not showing up:
    adb kill-server
    sudo adb start-server

gstreamer missing plugin:
    sudo apt-get install gstreamer0.10-plugins-ugly

phone doesn't have twisted:
    copy /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/twisted to app directory
    (same with required zope)
    delete *.so and *.a files

Your GStreamer installation is missing a plug-in
    sudo apt-get install ubuntu-restricted-extras
